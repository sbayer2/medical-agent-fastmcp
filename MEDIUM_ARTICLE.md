## The Challenge: Healthcare Meets Modern AI Development

Healthcare professionals increasingly rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for clinical documentation, but integrating specialized medical analysis tools with AI assistants like Claude Desktop or Cursor IDE has remained technically challenging. We needed a solution that could:

- Process medical documents (SOAP notes, lab reports, patient histories)
- Handle HIPAA-compliant data analysis
- Integrate payment processing for SaaS billing
- Work seamlessly with multiple LLM platforms
- Deploy reliably in a cloud environment

## Our Original Architecture: FastAgent + MCP

Our initial implementation used FastAgent with local MCP servers:

```python
# Original local architecture
medical_agent.py      # FastAgent application
api_server.py         # FastAPI wrapper
fastagent.config.yaml # MCP server configuration
```

While this worked locally, it required complex deployment orchestration and couldn't easily integrate with LLM clients that expect standardized MCP protocols.

## The Solution: FastMCP Cloud Migration

FastMCP Cloud emerged as the perfect solution—a managed platform specifically designed for hosting Model Context Protocol servers with enterprise-grade reliability.

### Step 1: Repository Setup

First, we created a dedicated GitHub repository for our FastMCP deployment:

```bash
# Repository structure
medical-agent-fastmcp/
├── medical_mcp_server.py     # Main server with 10 tools
├── requirements.txt          # Python dependencies
├── .env.template            # Environment variables template
├── README.md               # Documentation
└── simple_medical_server.py # Minimal fallback version
```

**GitHub Repository:** `https://github.com/[your-username]/medical-agent-fastmcp`

### Step 2: Server Architecture Design

We designed our MCP server with three categories of tools:

**Core Medical Tools:**
- `analyze_medical_document()` - AI-powered document analysis
- `get_patient_summary()` - Patient data retrieval
- `get_available_services()` - Service catalog

**Billing & Payment Tools:**
- `calculate_billing()` - Multi-tier pricing calculations
- `create_customer()` - Stripe customer management
- `create_payment_intent()` - Payment processing
- `confirm_payment()` - Payment verification
- `process_paid_analysis()` - End-to-end paid workflow
- `get_customer_info()` - Customer billing history

**System Tools:**
- `health_check()` - Server monitoring and validation

### Step 3: FastMCP Server Implementation

Here's the core server structure using the FastMCP framework:

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP
from typing import Dict, Any, Optional
import stripe
import os
from datetime import datetime

# Initialize FastMCP server
mcp = FastMCP("MedicalAgent")

# Configure API keys
stripe.api_key = os.getenv("STRIPE_API_KEY")

# Billing tiers configuration
BILLING_TIERS = {
    "basic": {"price": 0.10, "description": "Basic SOAP analysis"},
    "comprehensive": {"price": 0.50, "description": "Full medical analysis"},
    "batch": {"price": 0.05, "description": "Bulk processing per document"}
}

@mcp.tool
def health_check() -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Health check endpoint for service monitoring."""
    return {
        "status": "healthy",
        "service": "Medical Agent MCP Server",
        "version": "2.0.0",
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
    }

@mcp.tool
def analyze_medical_document(
    document_content: str,
    analysis_type: str = "basic",
    patient_id: Optional[str] = None
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Analyze medical document content and extract structured information."""
    
    # Medical analysis logic
    content_lower = document_content.lower()
    
    # Extract vital signs, medications, conditions
    analysis = {
        "analysis_type": analysis_type,
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
        "patient_id": patient_id,
        "extracted_data": {
            "vital_signs": extract_vital_signs(content_lower),
            "medications": extract_medications(content_lower),
            "conditions": extract_conditions(content_lower)
        }
    }
    
    return analysis

@mcp.tool
def create_customer(
    email: str,
    name: Optional[str] = None,
    description: Optional[str] = None
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Create a new Stripe customer for billing."""
    
    try:
        customer = stripe.Customer.create(
            email=email,
            name=name,
            description=description or f"Medical Analysis Customer - {email}"
        )
        
        return {
            "success": True,
            "customer_id": customer.id,
            "email": customer.email,
            "created": datetime.fromtimestamp(customer.created).isoformat()
        }
    except Exception as e:
        return {"error": f"Stripe error: {str(e)}", "success": False}

# Additional tools...
```

### Step 4: Dependency Management

One of the biggest challenges was managing Python dependencies for FastMCP Cloud. We encountered several version conflicts that required careful resolution:

```txt
# requirements.txt - Final working version
fastmcp>=2.2.6
pydantic>=2.0.0,<3.0.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
typing-extensions>=4.10.0,<5.0.0
stripe>=5.0.0
anthropic>=0.60.0
httpx>=0.25.0,<1.0.0
```

**Key Lessons Learned:**
- FastMCP 2.0.0 had compatibility issues; 2.2.6+ resolved them
- HTTPX version conflicts with Anthropic SDK required careful constraint management
- Upper bounds on version ranges prevent future compatibility breaks

### Step 5: Environment Configuration

We created a comprehensive environment template for API key management:

```bash
# .env.template
# Required for medical analysis
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key_here

# Required for payment processing
STRIPE_API_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key_here
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_stripe_publishable_key_here

# Optional for extended AI capabilities
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
```

### Step 6: FastMCP Cloud Deployment
