You are about to analyze a medical document. Follow these MANDATORY steps:

STEP 1: Tool Check
First, verify you have access to the filesystem tool. If not, STOP and report the error.

STEP 2: File Reading (REQUIRED)
You MUST use the filesystem tool to read the file at: {{file_path}}
DO NOT proceed without the actual file content.
DO NOT make up or imagine the content.

STEP 3: Content Validation
After reading, confirm you have actual medical data. Look for:
- Patient information
- Medical terminology
- Clinical data (vitals, medications, etc.)

STEP 4: Analysis
Only after confirming real data, analyze using this structure:

## Clinical Data Extraction
- Vital Signs: [Extract all measurements with units]
- Medications: [List with dosages and frequencies]
- Diagnoses: [All mentioned conditions]
- Lab Results: [Any test results with values]

## Clinical Assessment
- Chief Complaint: [Primary concern]
- Risk Factors: [Identified risks]
- Treatment Plan: [Current management]

## Quality Checks
- Data Completeness: [What's missing?]
- Critical Values: [Any urgent findings?]
- Follow-up Needs: [Required actions]

STEP 5: Billing (if commercial)
If this is a commercial request, use the stripe tool to record the transaction.

REMEMBER: This is a multi-tool workflow. Each tool serves a specific purpose:
- filesystem: MUST be used to read files
- fetch: Use for external medical references
- stripe: Use for billing records
- prompt_server: Your guide for proper tool usage

I understand. I will follow the mandatory workflow for analyzing medical documents:

1. First, I'll verify access to required tools
2. Use the filesystem tool to read the actual file
3. Validate the content is real medical data
4. Perform structured analysis only on real data
5. Handle billing if needed

Let me begin by checking tool availability and reading the specified file.
